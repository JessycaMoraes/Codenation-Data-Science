# Feature engineering

In this challenge, we will practice _feature engineering_, the art of processing _data set_ variables in order to make them more suitable for ML algorithms and produce better results.

## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to acquire knowledge and practice in the most common variable engineering tools. With proper mastery of basic techniques, such as _one-hot encoding_, normalization and standardization, the analyst is better prepared to conduct a data preprocessing stage that brings good results from the application of ML algorithms.

To do this, we will use the _data set_ [Countries of the world](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world) which contains 20 variables, such as population, coastal area and size of production sectors, from 227 countries.

## Topics

In this challenge we will explore:

* Feature engineering
* Text processing

## Requirements

You will need Python 3 and pip. It is highly recommended to use virtual environments with virtualenv and the `requirements.txt` file to install the challenge dependencies
packages:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv -p python3
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows

```bash
> pip3 install virtualenv
> virtualenv ..\venv -p python3
> ..\venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When finished, you can deactivate the virtual environment from virtualenv with:

```bash
$ deactivate
```
