# Probability Functions

In this challenge, we will practice hypothesis testing, one of the central concepts of statistical inference and all research that uses statistics as support.

## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to explore some hypothesis testing functions available in packages such as SciPy, learning how to interpret their results, be critical about their uses and understand a little about how they work.

To do this, we will use the _data set_ [2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro](https://www.kaggle.com/rio2016/olympic-games/) which consists of 11 variables regarding 11538 athletes who participated in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

## Topics

In this challenge, we will explore:

* Probability
* Statistics
* Hypothesis testing
* A/B testing

## Requirements

You will need Python 3 and pip. It is highly recommended to use virtual environments with virtualenv and the `requirements.txt` file to install the challenge dependencies packages:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv -p python3
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows

```bash
> pip3 install virtualenv
> virtualenv ..\venv -p python3
> ..\venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When finished, you can deactivate the virtual environment from virtualenv with:

```bash
$ deactivate
```
